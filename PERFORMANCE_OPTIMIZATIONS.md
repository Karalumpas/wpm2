## Sync Polling Optimization Summary

### ðŸš€ **Performance Optimizations Implemented**

#### 1. **Dynamic Refresh Intervals Based on Activity**
- **No jobs**: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- **Old jobs only**: 60 seconds (1 minute) 
- **Recent inactive jobs**: 15 seconds
- **Active jobs (running/queued)**: 3 seconds
- **Initial load**: 8 seconds

#### 2. **Tab Visibility Detection**
- **Active tab**: Normal polling intervals
- **Background tab**: Polling completely stopped (0ms interval)
- **Tab becomes active**: Automatic refresh on focus

#### 3. **Smart Sidebar Polling**
- **Active jobs present**: Always poll every 3 seconds (regardless of sidebar state)
- **Collapsed sidebar + no active jobs**: Slower polling (30s for recent, 2min for old jobs)
- **Expanded sidebar + no active jobs**: Normal polling (15s for recent, 1min for old jobs)
- **Visual indicator**: Blue dot on toggle button when jobs are active
- **Force refresh**: When sidebar expands after being collapsed

#### 4. **Enhanced Deduping & Caching**
- **Deduping interval**: 3 seconds (prevents duplicate requests)
- **Focus revalidation**: Enabled for fresh data when tab becomes active
- **Reconnect revalidation**: Disabled to prevent unnecessary requests

#### 5. **Debug Monitoring**
- **Console logs**: Show when sync jobs are being polled
- **Settings batching**: Show what settings are being saved together

### ðŸ“Š **Expected Performance Impact**

**Before optimization:**
```
GET /api/shops/sync/background 200 in 291ms  # Every 1.5s
GET /api/shops/sync/background 200 in 310ms  # Every 1.5s  
GET /api/shops/sync/background 200 in 309ms  # Every 1.5s
PUT /api/settings/user 200 in 301ms          # Every change
PUT /api/settings/user 200 in 291ms          # Every change
```

**After optimization:**
```
ðŸ”„ Polling sync jobs: all jobs                # Every 60s when no jobs
ðŸ’¾ Saving batched settings: ['theme', 'colorMode']  # Batched saves
GET /api/shops/sync/background 200 in 295ms  # Every 3s only during active syncs
```

**Reduction estimates:**
- **Sync polling**: 95% reduction when no active jobs
- **Settings saves**: 80-90% reduction through batching
- **Background tab**: 100% reduction in polling

### ðŸ§ª **Testing the Optimizations**

1. **Open Developer Console** to see debug logs
2. **Navigate between tabs** - polling should stop when tab is inactive
3. **Collapse/expand sidebar** - polling should pause/resume
4. **Change multiple settings quickly** - should see batched saves
5. **Start a sync job** - polling should increase to 3s intervals
6. **Let sync complete** - polling should slow down to 60s intervals

This should significantly reduce the network requests you're seeing! ðŸŽ‰
